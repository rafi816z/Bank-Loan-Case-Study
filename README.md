# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
Project Description 

This project aims to analyze a bank loan application dataset to uncover 
patterns and variables influencing loan default behaviour. The objective is to 
clean the data, handle missing values and outliers, evaluate data imbalance, 
and conduct univariate, bivariate, and correlation analysis to identify key risk 
factors. Insights derived will support data-driven decision-making for credit risk 
management.
