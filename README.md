# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
## üìä Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing a **bank loan application dataset** to uncover patterns and variables that influence **loan default behavior**. The primary objectives are to:

- Clean the dataset and handle missing values and outliers  
- Evaluate data imbalance and rectify it if necessary  
- Conduct univariate, bivariate, and correlation analyses  
- Identify key risk factors contributing to loan defaults  

The insights derived from this analysis aim to support **data-driven decision-making** in **credit risk management** by highlighting attributes strongly associated with borrower risk.
